# Conversation Enhanced Sample Application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-enhanced.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-enhanced)

This application demonstrates the combination of the [Conversation](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.shtml) and [Retrieve and Rank](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/retrieve-rank/#overview) services. First, users pose questions to the Conversation service. If Conversation is not able to confidently answer, Conversation Enhanced executes a call to Retrieve and Rank to provide the user with a list of helpful answers.

<b>Either way you deploy this app, you must have a Bluemix account and run some steps within Bluemix.</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<img src="readme_images/bluemix.png" width="200"/>](#bluemix)     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<img src="readme_images/local.png" width="200"/>](#local)

# How the app works
The application is designed and trained for chatting with a cognitive car.  The chat interface is on the left, and the JSON that the JavaScript code receives from the server is on the right. A user is able to ask two primary categories of questions.

Commands may be issued to the car to perform simple operations.  These commands are run against a small set of sample data trained with intents like "turn_on", "weather", and "capabilities".

Example commands that can be executed by the Conversation service are: 

    turn on windshield wipers
    play music

This app has also ingested and trained itself based on a car manual. In addition to conversational commands, you can also ask questions that you would expect to have answered in your car manual. For example:

    How do I check my tire pressure
    How do I turn on cruise control

# Getting Started using Bluemix
</a>

![](readme_images/Deploy on Bluemix - EIR app.png)

## Before you begin
1 Ensure that you have a [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/).

2 Ensure that you have the necessary space available in your Bluemix account. This action deploys 1 application and 3 services.
   * You can view this on your Bluemix Dashboard. Tiles will show what space you have available.
   * For example, for Services & APIS

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](readme_images/services.PNG)

## Deploy the App
1 Select Deploy to Bluemix

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-enhanced)

2 Log in with an existing Bluemix account or sign up.

3 Name your app and select your REGION, ORGANIZATION, and SPACE. Then select DEPLOY.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](readme_images/deployapp1.PNG)

* This performs multiple actions:
  - Creates the app
  - Creates a Document Conversion service instance for use with the Retrieve & Rank tooling
  - Creates a Conversation service instance that the user needs for workspace creation
  - Creates a Retrieve & Rank service instance

* The status of the deployment is shown. This can take some time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](readme_images/createproject.PNG)

4 Once your app has deployed, select VIEW YOUR APP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](readme_images/viewyourapp.PNG)

5 This lauches more actions, including:
  - Creating a SOLR cluster, config, and collection in the Retrieve & Rank service
  - Ingesting documents into the collection
  - Creating a trained ranker to aide in answering questions

A dialog shows the progress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](readme_images/deployPicture.PNG)

When setup is complete, you are informed that you need to add a WORKSPACE_ID.

<a name="returnbluemix">
6 Navigate to your Bluemix Dashboard and [import a workspace](#workspace). Setup your workspace then <b>return to these steps</b>.
</a>

7 Navigate to your Bluemix Dashboard and add [Service Credentials](#credentials). Then <b>return to these steps</b>.

8 After you have set up a workspace and added credentials, [add the WORKSPACE_ID environment variable](#env)


<a name="local">
# Getting Started locally
</a>

![](readme_images/Deploy locally - EIR app.png)


## Before you begin

-  Ensure that you have a [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/). While you can do part of this deployment locally, you must still use Bluemix.
-  Ensure that you have [Websphere Liberty Profile Server](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-non-eclipse-environments/).


## Building locally

To build the application:

1 Git clone the project `https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-enhanced`

2 Navigate to the `conversation-enhanced` folder

3 For Windows, type `gradlew.bat build`. Otherwise, type `gradlew build`.
- If you prefer, use your locally installed Gradle plugin instead of this provided wrapper.

4 The built WAR file (conversation-enhanced-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war) is in the `conversation-enhanced/build/libs/` folder.

5 Copy the WAR file into the Liberty install directory's dropins folder. For example, `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server profile>/dropins`.

## Setup Bluemix components

<a name="returnlocal">
1 In Bluemix, [create a Conversation Service](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/convo_getstart.shtml).
- Create the [Service Credentials](#credentials).
- [Import a workspace](#workspace)
</a>

2 In Bluemix, [create a Retrieve and Rank Service](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/retrieve-rank/get_start.shtml).
- Create the [Service Credentials](#credentials).

## Running locally


1 Navigate to the `conversation-enhanced/src/main/resources` folder. Copy the `server.env` file. 

2 Navigate to the `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server name>/` folder (where < server name > is the name of the Liberty server you wish to use). Paste the `server.env` here.

3 In the `server.env` file, search for **"retrieve_and_rank"**:
- Replace the "name" field with the name you gave your Retrieve and Rank Service.
- Replace the "password" field.
- Replace the "username" field.

4 In the `server.env`, search for **"conversation"**.
- Replace the "name" field with the name you gave your Conversation Service.
- Replace the "password" field.
- Replace the "username" field.

5 Add the **WORKSPACE_ID** that you [copied earlier](#workspaceID).

6 Start the server using Eclipse or CLI with the command `server run <server name>` (use the name you gave your server).

7 Liberty notifies you when the server starts and includes the port information.

8 Open your browser of choice and go to the URL displayed in Step 6. By default, this is `http://localhost:9080/`.

<a name="credentials">
# Service Credentials
</a>

1 Go to the Bluemix Dashboard and select the Conversation service instance. Once there, select the **Service Credentials** menu item.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](readme_images/credentials.PNG)

2 Select **ADD CREDENTIALS**. Name your credentials then select **ADD**.

3 Copy the credentials (or remember this location) for later use.

4 Return to the steps you were following:
- For Bluemix - [return to here](#returnbluemix)
- For Local - [return here](#returnlocal)

<a name="workspace">
# Import a workspace
</a>

To use the app you're creating, you need to add a worksapce to your Conversation service. A workspace is a container for all the artifacts that define the behavior of your service (ie: intents, entities and chat flows). For this sample app, a workspace is provided.

For more information on workspaces, see the full  [Conversation service  documentation](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/conversation/overview.shtml).

1 Navigate to the Bluemix dashboard, select the service you created.

2 Go to the **Manage** menu item and select **Launch Tool**. This opens a new tab in your browser, where you are prompted to login if you have not done so before. Use your Bluemix credentials.

3 Download the [exported JSON file](src/main/resources/workspace.json) that contains the Workspace contents.

4 Select the import icon: ![](readme_images/importGA.PNG). Browse to (or drag and drop) the JSON file that you downloaded in Step 3. Choose to import **Everything(Intents, Entities, and Dialog)**. Then select **Import** to finish importing the workspace.

5 Refresh your browser. A new workspace tile is created within the tooling. Select the _menu_ button within the workspace tile, then select **View details**:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Workpsace Details](readme_images/details.PNG)

<a name="workspaceID">
In the Details UI, copy the 36 character UNID **ID** field. This is the **Workspace ID**.
</a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](readme_images/workspaceid.PNG)

7 Return to the deploy steps that you were following:
- For Bluemix - [return to step 6](#returnbluemix)
- For Local - [return to step 1](#returnlocal)


<a name="env">
# Adding environment variables in Bluemix
</a>

1 In Bluemix, open the application from the Dashboard. Select **Environment Variables**.

2 Select **USER-DEFINED**.

3 Select **ADD**.

4 Add a variable with the name **WORKSPACE_ID**. For the value, paste in the Workspace ID you [copied earlier](#workspaceID). Select **SAVE**.
