# Conversation with Discovery [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-with-discovery.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-with-discovery)

This application demonstrates how you can combine the [Conversation](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.shtml) and [Discovery](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/discovery/#overview) services to allow customers, employees or the public to get answers to a wide range of questions about a product, service or other topic using plain English. First, users pose a questions to the Conversation service. If Conversation is not able to confidently answer, the app executes a call to Discovery, which to provides a list of helpful answers.

<b>Whether you deploy this app locally or on the Bluemix platform, you must have a Bluemix account and run some steps within Bluemix.</b>

## How the app works

The app has a conversational interface that can answer basic questions about a fictitious cognitive car, as well as more obscure questions whose answers can be found in the car’s manual. The app uses two Watson services: Conversation and Discovery. The Conversation service powers the basic Q&A using intents, relationships and natural language, and calls the Discovery app when it encounters questions it can’t answer. Discovery searches and ranks responses from the manual to answer those questions.

The application is designed and trained for chatting with your cognitive car. The chat interface is on the left, and the JSON that the JavaScript code receives from the server is on the right. A user is able to ask two primary categories of questions.

Commands may be issued to the car to perform simple operations.  These commands are run against a small set of sample data trained with intents like "turn_on", "weather", and "capabilities".

Example commands that can be executed by the Conversation service are:

    turn on windshield wipers
    play music

In addition to conversational commands, you can also ask questions that you would expect to have answered in your car manual. For example:

    How do I check my tire pressure
    How do I turn on cruise control
    How do I improve fuel efficiency
    How do I connect my phone to bluetooth

## Getting Started locally

<img src="readme_images/Deploy locally - EIR app.png" width="600"></img>

### Before you begin

-  Ensure that you have a [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/). While you can do part of this deployment locally, you must still use Bluemix.
-  Ensure that you have [Websphere Liberty Profile Server](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-non-eclipse-environments/).

<a name="returnlocal">
</a>

### Create the services

1. In Bluemix, [create a Conversation Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/services/conversation/).
  * Create the [Service Credentials](#credentials).
  * [Import a workspace](#workspace).

2. In Bluemix, [create a Discovery Service instance](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/services/discovery/).
  * Create the [Service Credentials](#credentials).
  * [Ingest the documents into a new Discovery collection](#ingestion).

### Building locally

To build the application:

1. Clone the repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-with-discovery
   ```

2. Navigate to the `conversation-with-discovery` folder

3. For Windows, type `gradlew.bat build`. Otherwise, type `gradlew build`.

4. The built WAR file (conversation-with-discovery-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war) is in the `conversation-with-discovery/build/libs/` folder.

### Running locally

1. Copy the WAR file generated above into the Liberty install directory's dropins folder. For example, `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server profile>/dropins`.  
2. Navigate to the `conversation-with-discovery/src/main/resources` folder. Copy the `server.env` file.  
3. Navigate to the `<liberty install directory>/usr/servers/<server name>/` folder (where < server name > is the name of the Liberty server you wish to use). Paste the `server.env` here.  
4. In the `server.env` file, in the **"conversation"** section.  
  - Populate the "password" field.
  - Populate the "username" field.
  - Add the **WORKSPACE_ID** that you [copied earlier](#workspaceID).  
5. In the `server.env` file, in the **"discovery"** section.  
  - Populate the "password" field.
  - Populate the "username" field.
  - Add the **COLLECTION_ID** and **ENVIRONMENT_ID** that you [copied from the Discovery UI](#environmentID)  
6. Start the server using Eclipse or CLI with the command `server run <server name>` (use the name you gave your server).  
7. Liberty notifies you when the server starts and includes the port information.  
8. Open your browser of choice and go to the URL displayed in Step 6. By default, this is `http://localhost:9080/`.

### Import a workspace

To use the app you're creating, you need to add a workspace to your Conversation service. A workspace is a container for all the artifacts that define the behavior of your service (ie: intents, entities and chat flows). For this sample app, a workspace is provided.

For more information on workspaces, see the full  [Conversation service  documentation](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/).

1. Navigate to the Bluemix dashboard and select the **Conversation** service you created.

  ![](readme_images/workspace_dashboard.png)

2. Click the **Launch Tool** button under the **Manage** tab. This opens a new tab in your browser, where you are prompted to login if you have not done so before. Use your Bluemix credentials.

  ![](readme_images/workspace_launch.png)

3. Download the [exported JSON file](src/main/resources/workspace.json) that contains the Workspace contents.

4. Select the import icon: ![](readme_images/importGA.PNG). Browse to (or drag and drop) the JSON file that you downloaded in Step 3. Choose to import **Everything(Intents, Entities, and Dialog)**. Then select **Import** to finish importing the workspace.

5. Refresh your browser. A new workspace tile is created within the tooling. Select the _menu_ button within the workspace tile, then select **View details**:
